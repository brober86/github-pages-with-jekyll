<h3 align="left" class="ass1font">Interest in IT:</h3>
<p align="justify" class="ass1select">When I was growing up as a  child we got our first PC when I was about nine years old; as my grandfather  who originally worked as a fitter &amp; turner for the railways eventually left  to work for a company called <a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=7578">Stromberg-Carlson  (Australasia)</a>. He worked there for a number of years and  eventually left to work for <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~bconlon/atl.htm">Automatic  Totalisators</a> teaching himself calculus and learning most things on the job.  Eventually, after many years of work Pop went on to install DOS based computers  in racecourses all around the world including Willmington – Delaware, USA for 6  months as well as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore , South Africa &amp; others.  Although I would like to credit Pop with my interest in computers, sadly, he  passed away 18 months after my injury  and much of his knowledge was never passed on to  me (something I now regret). </p>
<p align="justify" class="ass1select">So, as a result my interest  in IT largely came through necessity following a spinal cord injury in 2003. Subsequently,  I began studying for my HSC and it was evident that the PC was the only way  that I could feasibly do my homework and complete my assignments. So I started  to gain practical knowledge in how to operate a Windows based PC and how to  perform basic tasks such as word processing, writing and responding to emails,  web browsing et cetera. </p>
<p align="justify" class="ass1select">This basic interest in PCs  probably would have been the extent of my knowledge in them, however, one night  at the local pub I asked a mate of mine what he was doing with himself and he  told me that he was doing some freelance programming. I asked him how it was  that he got into it and his basic response was that he really wanted to know  how a computer worked in high school. There was something in the simplicity of his  response that struck a chord with me, and inspired a sense of curiosity. So,  when I returned to uni I did a YouTube search on ‘how to build a computer’ and  proceeded to watch countless hours of footage of custom-built PCs. From then on  I was hooked, and had a deep interest in how computers and their components  worked in unison to perform the functions of the user.</p>
